# Bi-Directional People Counter using ESP8266

This is an IoT-based smart visitor counter built using:
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Two IR sensors
- SG90 Servo Motor
- Blynk IoT Dashboard

The system counts how many people enter or exit a room and shows real-time occupancy on a mobile dashboard. If the limit is exceeded, a servo controls a barrier/door to restrict entry.

## Features
✔ People counting in both directions  
✔ Live IoT dashboard (Blynk)  
✔ Servo-based automatic door control  
✔ Real-time occupancy monitoring  
✔ Adjustable maximum capacity

## Hardware Used
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- IR Obstacle Sensor × 2
